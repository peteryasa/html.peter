<P>We often look to others and imagine them to have superhuman abilities or super-fortunate circumstances.<br/> But looking at my friends who I consider far more successful than myself, it's often just silently putting in the work, day after day. Everyone can count to a million, it's just whether you want to.

<br/>So, I hope that in June, you'll be brave and go after what you want.<hr/> Don't chase praise. Don't believe people who want to pay you with prestige. Don't overthink and just put in the work to become the version of you that you like the most.</P>
